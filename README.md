# Darcy React Exploration

## Overview
This code repo is a bit of the ordinary and is more of a fun way for me to try out small javascript / react things that I do not get to do in my day to day at work that. 

I wanted to create a repo that can act as a way to just try new things and incorporating things that may not have a business use case, but just seem cool and fun. 

### Note:
This project is still very much in its early stages and I will update this readme when there is more to say about the components and when it gets hosted online sometime. Until then, please just run locally :D

## Getting Started
Just the classic install and run:
```npm install``` and ```npm start```
